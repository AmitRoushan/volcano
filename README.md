Volcano is a Kubernetes-based system for high performance workload, providing mechanisms for applications
which would like to run high performance workload leveraging Kubernetes, e.g. Tensorflow, Spark, MPI.

Volcano builds upon a decade and a half of experience on running high performance workload workloads at scale
using several systems, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the open source community.
